## Local Development / Contributing

### Setup

- Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/)
- Install dependencies `deno install`
  - Use same mental model as `npm install`
- Auth your CLI with `deno run prod login`

### Development Loop

- Make code changes
- Test changes with
  - `deno run devv` to test against local API
  - `deno run prod` to test against production API
  - The `deno run <env>` is an alias to the user facing `sf` command. So if you
    wanted to run `sf login` locally against the local API, run
    `deno run devv login`

## New Release

This is ran locally

- `deno run release <major|minor|patch>`
