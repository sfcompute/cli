description: Describes the CLI project
globs:

- This is a CLI program written in Deno using the `commander` library and `@commander-js/extra-typings`.

- When using node globals like `console.log`, `setTimeout`, `process`, etc, import them from the corresponding explicit `node:console`, `node:timers`, and `node:process`, etc.
- Where possible, use the `openapi-typescript`/`openapi-fetch` client instead of writing raw fetch calls.
